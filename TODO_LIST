Verbose listing of devices on system
Extensive check for supported feature list
Option to select different GPU types, (Integrated, Discrete or even CPU, just for science)
Properly selecting queue types (Individual graphic/compute/trasfer queue, care for resource share!)
Dynamic memory management of Vertex and Index buffers (suballocation)
Transforming classes to structures of arrays (I will try to implement Data oriented Design)
Basic Compute pipeline and synchronization with graphic pipeline
